## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use better CSS Grid!


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  onclick('ðŸŽ‰');
  toggle;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to keep going even more because this challenge was a hard one, so I see that I have a lot to improve, mainly with CSS!
